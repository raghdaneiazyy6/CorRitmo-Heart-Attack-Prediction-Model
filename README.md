# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction Model

This research project aimed at developing a Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction Model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification approach. The model incorporates various data indicators from the [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset) available on Kaggle.
