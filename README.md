# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction Model

Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are a significant global health concern. Early prediction of heart attacks can greatly improve patient outcomes. In this research project, we leverage the power of machine learning, specifically the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, to build a predictive model for heart attack analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset) available on Kaggle. It includes a comprehensive set of health indicators and attributes that are crucial for heart attack prediction.
